## Overview

This project implements an MCP server that enables Claude to connect to ServiceNow instances, retrieve data, and perform actions through the ServiceNow API. It serves as a bridge between Claude and ServiceNow, allowing for seamless integration.

## Features

- Connect to ServiceNow instances using various authentication methods (Basic, OAuth, API Key)
- Query ServiceNow records and tables
- Create, update, and delete ServiceNow records
- Execute ServiceNow scripts and workflows
- Access and query the ServiceNow Service Catalog
- Analyze and optimize the ServiceNow Service Catalog
- Debug mode for troubleshooting
- Support for both stdio and Server-Sent Events (SSE) communication

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- A ServiceNow instance with appropriate access credentials

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/servicenow-mcp.git
   cd servicenow-mcp
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install the package:
   ```
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with your ServiceNow credentials:
   ```
   SERVICENOW_INSTANCE_URL=https://your-instance.service-now.com
   SERVICENOW_USERNAME=your-username
   SERVICENOW_PASSWORD=your-password
   SERVICENOW_AUTH_TYPE=basic  # or oauth, api_key
   ```

## Usage

### Standard (stdio) Mode

To start the MCP server:

```
python -m servicenow_mcp.cli
```

Or with environment variables:

```
SERVICENOW_INSTANCE_URL=https://your-instance.service-now.com SERVICENOW_USERNAME=your-username SERVICENOW_PASSWORD=your-password SERVICENOW_AUTH_TYPE=basic python -m servicenow_mcp.cli
```

### Server-Sent Events (SSE) Mode

The ServiceNow MCP server can also run as a web server using Server-Sent Events (SSE) for communication, which allows for more flexible integration options.

#### Starting the SSE Server

You can start the SSE server using the provided CLI:

```
servicenow-mcp-sse --instance-url=https://your-instance.service-now.com --username=your-username --password=your-password
```

By default, the server will listen on `0.0.0.0:8080`. You can customize the host and port:

```
servicenow-mcp-sse --host=127.0.0.1 --port=8000
```

#### Connecting to the SSE Server

The SSE server exposes two main endpoints:

- `/sse` - The SSE connection endpoint
- `/messages/` - The endpoint for sending messages to the server

#### Example

See the `examples/sse_server_example.py` file for a complete example of setting up and running the SSE server.

```python
from servicenow_mcp.server import ServiceNowMCP
from servicenow_mcp.server_sse import create_starlette_app
from servicenow_mcp.utils.config import ServerConfig, AuthConfig, AuthType, BasicAuthConfig
import uvicorn

# Create server configuration
config = ServerConfig(
    instance_url="https://your-instance.service-now.com",
    auth=AuthConfig(
        type=AuthType.BASIC,
        config=BasicAuthConfig(
            username="your-username",
            password="your-password"
        )
    ),
    debug=True,
)

# Create ServiceNow MCP server
servicenow_mcp = ServiceNowMCP(config)

# Create Starlette app with SSE transport
app = create_starlette_app(servicenow_mcp, debug=True)

# Start the web server
uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8080)
```

## Tool Packaging (Optional)

To manage the number of tools exposed to the language model (especially in environments with limits), the ServiceNow MCP server supports loading subsets of tools called "packages". This is controlled via the `MCP_TOOL_PACKAGE` environment variable.

### Configuration

1.  **Environment Variable:** Set the `MCP_TOOL_PACKAGE` environment variable to the name of the desired package.
    ```bash
    export MCP_TOOL_PACKAGE=catalog_builder
    ```
2.  **Package Definitions:** The available packages and the tools they include are defined in `config/tool_packages.yaml`. You can customize this file to create your own packages.

### Behavior

-   If `MCP_TOOL_PACKAGE` is set to a valid package name defined in `config/tool_packages.yaml`, only the tools listed in that package will be loaded.
-   If `MCP_TOOL_PACKAGE` is **not set** or is empty, the `full` package (containing all tools) is loaded by default.
-   If `MCP_TOOL_PACKAGE` is set to an invalid package name, the `none` package is loaded (no tools except `list_tool_packages`), and a warning is logged.
-   Setting `MCP_TOOL_PACKAGE=none` explicitly loads no tools (except `list_tool_packages`).

### Available Packages (Default)

The default `config/tool_packages.yaml` includes the following role-based packages:

-   `service_desk`: Tools for incident handling and basic user/knowledge lookup.
-   `catalog_builder`: Tools for creating and managing service catalog items, categories, variables, and related scripting (UI Policies, User Criteria).
-   `change_coordinator`: Tools for managing the change request lifecycle, including tasks and approvals.
-   `knowledge_author`: Tools for creating and managing knowledge bases, categories, and articles.
-   `platform_developer`: Tools for server-side scripting (Script Includes), workflow development, and deployment (Changesets).
-   `system_administrator`: Tools for user/group management and viewing system logs.
-   `agile_management`: Tools for managing user stories, epics, scrum tasks, and projects.
-   `full`: Includes all available tools (default).
-   `none`: Includes no tools (except `list_tool_packages`).

### Introspection Tool

-   **`list_tool_packages`**: Lists all available tool package names defined in the configuration and shows the currently loaded package. This tool is available in all packages except `none`.

## Available Tools

### Using the MCP CLI

The ServiceNow MCP server can be installed with the MCP CLI, which provides a convenient way to register the server with Claude.

```bash
# Install the ServiceNow MCP server with environment variables from .env file
mcp install src/servicenow_mcp/server.py -f .env
```

This command will register the ServiceNow MCP server with Claude and configure it to use the environment variables from the .env file.

### Integration with Claude Desktop

To configure the ServiceNow MCP server in Claude Desktop:

1. Edit the Claude Desktop configuration file at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or the appropriate path for your OS:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ServiceNow": {
      "command": "/Users/yourusername/dev/servicenow-mcp/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": [
        "-m",
        "servicenow_mcp.cli"
      ],
      "env": {
        "SERVICENOW_INSTANCE_URL": "https://your-instance.service-now.com",
        "SERVICENOW_USERNAME": "your-username",
        "SERVICENOW_PASSWORD": "your-password",
        "SERVICENOW_AUTH_TYPE": "basic"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

2. Restart Claude Desktop to apply the changes

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Errors with Change Management Tools

1. **Error: `argument after ** must be a mapping, not CreateChangeRequestParams`**
   - This error occurs when you pass a `CreateChangeRequestParams` object instead of a dictionary to the `create_change_request` function.
   - Solution: Make sure you're passing a dictionary with the parameters, not a Pydantic model object.
   - Note: The change management tools have been updated to handle this error automatically. The functions will now attempt to unwrap parameters if they're incorrectly wrapped or passed as a Pydantic model object.

2. **Error: `Missing required parameter 'type'`**
   - This error occurs when you don't provide all required parameters for creating a change request.
   - Solution: Make sure to include all required parameters. For `create_change_request`, both `short_description` and `type` are required.

3. **Error: `Invalid value for parameter 'type'`**
   - This error occurs when you provide an invalid value for the `type` parameter.
   - Solution: Use one of the valid values: "normal", "standard", or "emergency".

4. **Error: `Cannot find get_headers method in either auth_manager or server_config`**
   - This error occurs when the parameters are passed in the wrong order or when using objects that don't have the required methods.
   - Solution: Make sure you're passing the `auth_manager` and `server_config` parameters in the correct order. The functions have been updated to handle parameter swapping automatically.
